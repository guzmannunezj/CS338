Everyone has access to the following: 

symmetric encryption algorithm AES ~ AES(K,M) where M = message encrypted and K = key used (key has to be agreed on using Diffie-Hellman key exchange proceedure ~ special phrase used to talk about this); AES_D(K,C) where C = ciphertext (remember that we are using a block cipher mode like CBC) 
cruptographic hash function SHA-256 ~ H(M) where it represents the hash of the message M
public/secret key pairs ~ (P,S); Alice: (P_A, S_A); Bob: (P_B, S_B) --- remember that public key encryption is used for short messages b/c much slower than symmetric encryption

1. AES with public/secret key pairs: can use public/secret key pairs to be able to go about the Diffie-Hellman key procedure
(Alice can send Bob a key that they will both use, no 'agreement' will take place, one person will establish the key that 
will be used), and from then on, Eve cannot attempt adversary in the middle as they don't have fake keys nor the actual 
information about K to be able to read the message and pretend she wasn't there

2. AES with public/secret key pairs and hash funciton SHA_256: use the same procedure used above but with a twist, to verify that the messages they send to each other are not being modified they send a hash number along with their message so Mal 
cannot modify anything without getting away with it

3. AES with public/secret key pairs and *****search in notes to see how they can verify that its them who is sending the message with secret key?***** would it be a message that Alice's public key can decrypt? maybe not

4. Alice claims: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
How plausible each claim is: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

5. The formula CA would use to compute Sig_CA is: 
E(S_CA, H(Cert_B))

6. That is not enough for Alice to believe she is talking to Bob because the certificate could be expired or it could 
have been tampered with. (Or it could even be a fake!) Alice could encode a message using the public key in the 
certificateand ask Bob to send the message back to Alice in plain text using her public key. 

7. Two ways the certificate-based trust system could be subverted, allowing Mal to convince Alice that Mal is Bob: 
(one) Mal could easily let Alice interrogate Bob about his identity and truthfulness, but after that interrogation is over 
and Bob has established that he is the real Bob, Mal could still come in and act as man-in-the-middle, pretending to be Bob 
and modifying messages and whatnot (this would only work if the communication that is taking place between Alice, Mal, 
and Bob is through AES and not private/public key pairs).

(two) Mal could also use an expired certificate and pretend to be Bob.
