1. AES with Diffie-Hellman key exchange procedure: Alice can establish a shared key K with Bob 
by using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange procedure. After having agreed on the key K, Alice 
can go on and use the symmetric encryption algorithm AES to encrypt her long message to send 
it to Bob, AES(K, M). This works as AITM is impossible, so we do not need to worry about Eve 
listening or modifying messages without Alice nor Bob noticing. By setting a shared key that 
is kept secret from Eve, Eve can't read the messages as she doesn't have access to K to be 
able to decypher the messages and read them. 

2. AES, Diffie-Hellman with public/secret key pairs, and hash funciton SHA_256: By encyrpting 
the information that is sent back and forth in a Diffie-Hellman key echange procedure using 
the public/secret key pairs to establish a secret shared key K, Alice and Bob are making sure 
that only they can decrypt the small integer/equation messages, keeping Mal from being nosy. 
After having set up their secret shared key K, Alice is able to send Bob a long message by 
encrypting it, AES(K, M). Along with the encrypted message, Alice would send Bob a hash of te message so that he is able to know whether or not the message he received was tampered with. Bob would have to calulate the hash of the message and if he got the same value as the one 
that Alice sent him, he will know the message was not modified by Mal. 

3. AES with public/secret key pairs and *****search in notes to see how they can verify that its them who is sending the message with secret key?***** would it be a message that Alice's public key can decrypt? maybe not

4. Alice claims: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
How plausible each claim is: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

5. The formula CA would use to compute Sig_CA is: 
E(S_CA, H(Cert_B))

6. That is not enough for Alice to believe she is talking to Bob because the certificate could 
be expired or it could have been tampered with. (Or it could even be a fake!) Alice could 
encode a message using the public key in the certificateand ask Bob to send the message back 
to Alice in plain text using her public key. 

7. Two ways the certificate-based trust system could be subverted, allowing Mal to convince 
Alice that Mal is Bob: 
(one) Mal could easily let Alice interrogate Bob about his identity and truthfulness, but 
after that interrogation is over and Bob has established that he is the real Bob, Mal could 
still come in and act as man-in-the-middle, pretending to be Bob and modifying messages and 
whatnot (this would only work if the communication that is taking place between Alice, Mal, 
and Bob is through AES and not private/public key pairs).

(two) Mal could also use an expired certificate and pretend to be Bob.
