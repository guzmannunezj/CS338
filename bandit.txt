In each level, there will be instructions for how to get the password you need to move on to the next level. 
The instructions will be written in a numbered list. The number in front of the phrase you need to write should not
be included in the text that you write into the terminal. It should all be straightforward and easy. When writing in the terminal, know that exactly how the phrase looks like here should be the exact same way it should look in the terminal (include all spaces and dots and slashes and whatnot). If you ever see '<tab>' that means to press the Tab button (as pressing the Tab button will automatically fill the rest of the name of a file or directory for you on the terminal). The lesson is simply there for educational purposes only, it does not need to be written in the terminal or anything like that, it simply helps understand what was going on. 

Level 0 
password: bandit0 

Level 0 -> 1
1   cat readme 
Password Obtained: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
Lesson: The command 'cat' opens up a file and shows the contents of the file on the terminal. 

Level 1 -> 2
1   cat ./- 
Password Obtained: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
Lesson: The './' is a way of helping the computer know that from the current directory we are in (which is 
represented by the '.') we will be looking at the file that comes after the '/' (the slash symbol is a directory 
seperator, it seperates the name of the directory from the file we are going to be looking at). 

Level 2 - 3
1   ls
2   cat sp<tab> 
Password Obtained: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
Lesson: The terminal is happy with either the name of the file being in quotation marks or having back slashes 
placed in front of every space there is in the name of a file. For example, if a file is called 'spaces in this 
filename', you could either type 'cat "spaces in this filename" ' or 'cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename ' .

Level 3-4 
1   ls -al
2   cd inhere
3   ls -al
4   cat ...Hiding-From-You
Password Obtained: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
Lesson: The command 'cd' helps you move from the current directory you are in to whichever directory you want to 
move to. 

Level 4 - 5
1   ls -al
2   cd inhere
3   ls -al
6   file ./*
7   cat ./-file07
Password Obtained: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
Lesson: The command 'file' helps you identify what type of information a file has, whether it is readable text 
(ASCII II), data, or something else. The symbols './*' that come after the command basically tell the computer
hey, I want to know the file types of everything that is in the current directory we are in. The asterisk is a 
wildcard. [need more clarification on what the asterisk does and how it was able to select all the files]. 

Level 5 - 6 
1   ls
2   cd inhere
3   ls -al *
4   cd maybehere07
5   ls -al
6   cat .file2
Password Obtained: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
Lesson: 

Level 6 - 7 
1   cd /      
2   find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null    
3   cat ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Password Obtained: morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
Lesson: The line 'cd /' will get you to the topmost directory there is. The command line 'find [directory] -user [
name of user] -group [name of group]' basically said 'in a specific directory, find the file that has this 
specific user an this specific group and return it. The '2>/dev/null' was necessary to make annoying text 
and warning go away. 

Level 7 - 8 
1   ls -al
2   cat data.txt
3   grep millionth data.txt      
Password Obtained: dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
Lesson: The 'grep' command finds the specific phrase you are looking for (which in this case was the word 
millionth) in the file you provide it with and it returns the line of text where it found the phrase in. 

Level 8 - 9 
1   ls -al 
2   sort data.txt | uniq -c
Password Obtained: 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
Lesson: The command 'sort' sorts the text in the file and 'uniq -c' returns the number of times a certain phrase 
was repeated. [could there have been a better solution? a more simpler one?]

Level 9 - 10 
1   ls -al
2   strings data.txt
Password Obtained: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
Lesson: The 'strings' command seperated all the characters in the file into groups of 4 characters or more that 
end with a new-line or a null character 
(definition found in https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=s-strings-command).  

Level 10 - 11 
1   ls -al
2   base64 –decode data.txt
Password Obtained: dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr
Lesson: The command 'base64 -decode' tells the computer to decode the file that was originally encoded using the 
command base64 (complicated process that involves 1s and 0s and letters). [need better understanding of how 
base64 gets encoded in the first place]

Level 11 - 12 
1   ls -al
2   cat data.txt | tr ‘A-ZA-z’ ‘N-ZA-Mn-za-m’
Password Obtained: 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
Lesson: The command 'tr'serves as a translator. [hard to explain and hard to grasp concept of it as well]
