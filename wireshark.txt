===== DAYTIME =====

1.) The parts of the TCP 3-way handshake are:

  1   192.168.106.129   129.6.15.28   TCP   48366 --> 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=32120 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSv...
  2   129.6.15.28   192.168.106.129   TCP   13 --> 48366 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 
  3   192.168.106.129   129.6.15.28   TCP   48366 --> 13 [ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=32120 Len=0 

2.) The port number the cient uses for this interaction is: 48366. 

3.) The client needs a port because just like the server, the client is running many different software servers at the same time and it needs to have a port so 
the server knows where to send the information that the client requested in the first place. 

4.) The frame that contains the actual date and time: 

  4   129.6.15.28   192.168.106.129   DAYTIME   DAYTIME Response

5.) [SYN] means "a synchronization message typically used to reequest a connection between a client and a server" (Vinicius Fulber-Garcia, TCP: Differences Between FIN
and RST). [ACK] means "an acknowledgement message employed to declare the receipt of a particular message" (Vinicius Fulber-Garcia, TCP: Differences Between FIN and RST).

6.) The entity nc client initiated the closing of the TCP connection, as it can be seen here: 

  5   192.168.106.129   129.6.15.28   TCP   48366 --> 13 [FIN, ACK] Seq=1 Ack=53 Win=32068 Len=0 

===== HTTP =====

1.) There were two TCP connections opened. The first two lines of information on wireshark show [SYN], meaning that the client was asking the server
two seperate times to make a connection. Also, there are two corresponding lines that show [SYN, ACK], showing that the server did in fact recieve
the invites and sent them back. (I hope I am counting the connections right.)

2.) I can tell where the homepage (index.html) was requested, as it shows on line 5:
  5   192.168.106.129   172.233.221.124   HTTP   398 GET / HTTP/1.1 

3.) I can tell where the photograph (jeff-square-colorado.jpg) was requested, as it shows on line :
  11   192.168.106.129   172.233.221.124   HTTP   371 GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1

===== QUESTIONS =====

I get why we are shown the Source and Destination IP addresses and ports and the protocol being used in Wireshark, but why are we shown the Length? Why is 
that useful information? 

What does Seq, Ack, Win, Len, MSS, SACK_PERM TSv... mean in the Info column?

When trying to search in the web browser Firefox what type of information SSL hides, AI Overview informed me about how SSL makes it impossible for hackers to read "data
in transit" but "SSL can also be misused by cybercriminals to hide dangerous content, such as malware, viruses, and spyware...". How is that so?

What does [TCP Window Full] 80 --> 48068 [PSH, ACK] ....... mean?

What is up with all the [PSH, ACK] and [ACK] there is in the later lines of information?
